    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Now, to go with the enchilada recipe that we make
        every Christmas, here are the best margaritas ever.
        They are simple to make, not too sugary, and get the 
        job done. These are a must when making our enchilada
        recipe as they pair well with the Mexican food theme.
